Q&A Forum

ABSTRACT:
 
 Question and Answer (Q&A) systems play a vital role in our daily life for information and knowledge sharing. Users post questions and pick 
 questions to answer in the system. Due to the rapidly growing user population and the number of questions, it is unlikely for a user to 
 stumble upon a question by chance that (s)he can answer. Also, altruism does not encourage all users to provide answers, not to mention 
 high quality answers with a short answer wait time. The primary objective of this project is to improve the performance of Q&A systems by
 actively forwarding questions to users who are capable and willing to answer the questions. To this end, we have designed and implemented
 SocialQ&A, an online social network based Q&A system. SocialQ&A leverages the social network properties of common-interest and mutual-
 trust friend relationship to identify an asker through friendship who are most likely to answer the question, and enhance the user 
 security. We also improve SocialQ&A with security and efficiency enhancements by protecting user privacy and identifies, and retrieving 
 answers automatically for recurrent questions. We describe the architecture and algorithms, and conducted comprehensive large-scale 
 simulation to evaluate SocialQ&A in comparison with other methods. Our results suggest that social networks can be leveraged to improve 
 the answer quality and askerâ€™s waiting time.
